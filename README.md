Q: What is Makaney Code?
Makaney code is a human-friendly alphanumeric representation (like postal or zip codes) of the geographic latitude and longitude coordinates. Using Makaney code helps easily identify places on earth with an easy to remember code. That's becomes very useful especially in countries that do not implement a practical postal code system. In such countries people tend to describe their locations using directions, which is not always straightforward, waste valuable time, and results in many inconveniences especially when an ambulance needs to reach a certain location as soon as possible.
